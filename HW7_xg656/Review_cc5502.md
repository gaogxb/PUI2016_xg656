Plot:

![plot_xg656] (https://github.com/connorchency/PUI2016_cc5502/blob/master/HW8_cc5502/plot_xg656.png)

**CLARITY:** *is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?*

This plot looks clear to me. It is a simple but well presented bar plot that shows the number of Starbucks in each of the five boroughs of New York City. It is easy to read especially that the author arrange the bars in a descending order.

**ESTHETIC:** *beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?*

It is a beautiful graph. The color looks good to me. The plot clearly communicates what the author tries to show, and quantities are indicated explicitly without hiding or twisting the scale in the plot. The dashed lines also help viewers to understand the numbers.

**HONESTY:** *is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?*

It is reproducing the data.
